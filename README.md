🚀 JavaScript Project Showcase 🚀

Welcome to my collection of JavaScript projects! This repository is a playground where I explore and implement various JavaScript concepts, ranging from fundamental DOM manipulation to complex asynchronous operations with APIs. You'll find 15–20 projects that demonstrate my journey and skills as a developer.

Dive in, explore the code, and check out the live demos!

✨ Featured Projects

Here are some of the highlights from the collection. Each project is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

🔢 Tables Generator

A handy tool to generate multiplication tables on the fly. It includes a feature to specify the upper limit of the table, making it flexible and user-friendly.
